# Bank Customer Attrition Prediction Service

This project tackles the challenge of predicting customer churn in a banking context. It leverages machine learning models to identify customers at risk of leaving, allowing banks to proactively implement retention strategies.

#Key Achievements:

-->High-Performance Model: A customer attrition classification model was built using Random Forest and XGBoost algorithms, achieving an accuracy of 87%. This indicates the model's strong ability to correctly classify churning and non-churning customers.

-->Balanced Approach: Model optimization focused on achieving a balanced F1 score of 0.63. The F1 score considers both precision (predicting churn correctly) and recall (not missing churned customers), ensuring the model performs well in identifying both types of customers.
-Interactive Web App: A user-friendly Streamlit web application was developed. This allows users to visualize the model's behavior and potentially interact with it to explore customer churn risk factors.

#Benefits:

-->Reduced Churn: By predicting potential churn, banks can implement targeted interventions to retain valuable customers, leading to increased customer lifetime value.
-->Data-Driven Decisions: The model provides insights into customer churn, allowing banks to make data-driven decisions regarding retention strategies and resource allocation.
-->Improved Customer Experience: Proactive retention efforts can lead to a more positive customer experience, fostering stronger bank-customer relationships.

This project demonstrates a successful application of machine learning in the banking industry for customer churn prediction. The combination of high accuracy, balanced performance, and a user-friendly interface makes this a valuable tool for banks seeking to improve customer retention.
